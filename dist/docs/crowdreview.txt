Our crowd review genome*:

<table border="1" style="margin: 1em 0; text-align: left">
    <tr>
        <th>What?</th>
        <th>Who?</th>
        <th>Why?</th>
        <th>How?</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Decide on uploaded pictures</th>
        <th>Crowd</th>
        <th>Love, Glory</th>
        <th>Group Decision</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Decide on uploaded videos</th>
        <th>Crowd</th>
        <th>Love, Glory</th>
        <th>Group Decision</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Decide on profile pictures</th>
        <th>Crowd</th>
        <th>Love, Glory</th>
        <th>Group Decision</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Decide on verification pictures</th>
        <th>Moderators</th>
        <th>Love</th>
        <th>Individual Decision</th>
    </tr>
</table>

Future versions of the site will also allow reviewing forum posts.  Judging forum posts requires knowing the context of the post. For now, we start with a crowd review of the uploaded images and videos.
